Welcome to TykeBot, making a plugin is easy!

Just create a script in the plugins dir.  When the bot loads up, your script will be run and have access to a plugin variable, which is an instance of lib/plugin.rb already setup for your script.  Simply use the plugin DSL or the plugin object to add commands,s access your plugin.config, or get access to the raw bot object plugin.bot.

ex:

  1 command(:about,
  2   :syntax      => 'about',
  3   :description => 'About me, the bot!',
  4 ) {
  5 "I'm a chat bot, duh!
  6 
  7 You can find my base source available by doing one of the following git clones:
  8 
  9 read/write access (request access through github)
 10 git clone git@github.com:tykeal/TykeBot.git
 11 
 12 read only access
 13 git clone git://github.com/tykeal/TykeBot.git"
 14 }

Note you can use the plugin variable / DSL from within the command block as well.

If you have multiple files for your plugin, you can create a directory in plugins/ and make an init.rb script.  Everything else will be the same, but you can plugin.require('yourfile') without having to worry about paths, just use relative paths from your directory.
